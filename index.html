After having received your order, we will send you a confirmation email with your order number and details of the items you have ordered.

              <p>Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.

              <p><h4>a. Information We Collect</h4></p>
              <p>The Information We Collect section describes the personal information we may collect from you, including the categories of sources of that information.

              <p><h4>b. Your Rights</h4></p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>
                    <p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>

                        <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (known as “data portability request”).</li>
                        <li>If applicable, categories of personal information sold about you and the categories of third parties to which the personal information was sold.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Deletion Request Rights</h4>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
                    </p>
                    <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
                      <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
                      <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                      <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                      <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).</li>
                      <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
                      <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
                      <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>               
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h4>
                    <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us at: support@sizl.com.  Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: First Name, Last Name, Email used to register with Sizl, and Phone Number</li>
                      <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
